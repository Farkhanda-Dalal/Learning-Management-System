# Learning-Management-System
Another Java Full Stack Project from 2023. This is an MVC project that has 2 interfaces: Teacher , Student. 
The Teacher Dashboard allows teacher to create, delete, view classes; create to-do lists. Class interface on Teacher's side allows them to view attendence, enrollment, upload assignments.
The Student Dashboard allows students to join, leave, view classes; create to-do lists.
The project also uses SMTP protocols to send OTPs and Class Codes (Class code is sent to respective students when teacher creates a class).
